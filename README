A few pieces of code, and a cheap USB fax modem, and you can click telephone numbers on the Interwebs to dial them, instead of actually reaching over to the phone and punching the buttons. When I'm in a hurry I keep hitting the wrong buttons...

What you need:
A USB fax modem. AliExpress has some $8-$10 ones.
A Linux computer (RPi will work) that is near your phone line.
Some Windows/Linux computers to make use of the dialer!

Installation instructions:
1) Install the GreaseMonkey script, PhoneLink.user.js.
2) Edit dialer.c and put in the hostname or IP of the server in the #define HOSTNAME line near the top of the file, and uncomment it.
3) Compile the dialer.c file: gcc dialer.c -o dialer for Linux. For Windows: gcc -mwindows dialer.c -o dialer.exe -lws2_32
4 Have your browser use it to handle tel: links.
	For Firefox (I'm not sure about other browsers, Google is your friend!):
	a) Go to about:config, and create a new Boolean named "network.protocol-handler.expose.tel" and set the value to false.
	b) Go click a tel: link and choose dialer.exe as the program to use to open tel: links.
5) Copy dial_server.rb on some Linux host (or Raspberry Pi) that has Ruby installed that is near your phone line.
6) Connect the modem to the server, and plug in the modem to the phone line.
7) Check that the modem created a /dev/ttyACM* entry, most likely /dev/ttyACM0. If it is different, you will need to edit dial_server.rb and put the correct string in place.
8) Put in your phone exchange (the first three digits of a local seven digit number) in dial_server.rb, so it can remove the area code for local calls.
9) Start dial_server.rb (via cron, startup scripts, whatever you want!) and make sure its user is a member of 'dialout', so it can access /dev/ttyACM*.
10) Go Google your favorite business, and click the phone link to dial!
